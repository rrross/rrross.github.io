I am a second-year Statistics PhD student at UChicago. My research is focused on developing effective statistical inference methods for black-box models, using frameworks such as conformal prediction and knockoffs. I am also interested in creating modified machine learning algorithms that are particularly suited for interpretability. While these approaches have broad applicability in mind, I am frequently inspired by climate forecasting and box-office prediction for films.
