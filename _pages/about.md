I am a second-year Statistics PhD student at UChicago working with [Rebecca Willett](https://willett.psd.uchicago.edu) and [Rina Foygel Barber](https://rinafb.github.io). My research is focused on developing effective statistical inference methods for black-box models, using frameworks such as conformal prediction and knockoffs. While these approaches have broad applicability in mind, I am frequently inspired by climate forecasting and film datasets.
